	Unikernels er fremtiden
	-----------------------

	"The most revered feature of the modern operating system is support
	 for running existing applications. Minimally implemented application
	 support is a few thousand lines of code plus the drivers, as we
	 demonstrated with the Rumprun unikernel. Therefore, there is no
	 reason to port and cram an operating system into every problem space."
